This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Front-End Developer Test

## Overview

Your client has tasked you with making the Ultimate Moviegoers Guide using _The Movie Database API_. They are asking for an app that at least covers the following:

* Shows the user a list of movies where the user can sort by
  * Now Playing
  * Popular
  * Top Rated
* Allows the user to search for a movie
* Allows the user to select a movie and see more details. The more details, the better.

Best of all is the client has given you full creative control.
Make the Ultimate Moviegoers Guide the best looking app out there.
Feel free to use any front-end framework of your choice - React, React-Native, Vue, Vue Native, Angular, Ember etc.

### Keep in mind the following questions

* What design patterns did you use?
* How would you test your application?
* How do you manage/store application state?
* What ways could you structure the code to make it easy to understand and maintain?
* What other considerations and tradeoffs did you make when building the application?
